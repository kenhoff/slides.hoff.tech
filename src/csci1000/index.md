# Spark Classes

I'm teaching **Front End Web Dev** and **Back End Web Dev** at [Spark Boulder](http://sparkboulder.com/) in the Fall.

Spark is an entrepreneurial student co-working space on the Hill - underneath the food court! It was founded a couple years back by my buddy [Fletcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fletchrichman).

## Microsoft

Started working for Microsoft July 2014

I was a "Program Manager" - Microsoft's version of a "Product Manager"

Worked on **[Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/)** - on a tiny little feature called "Reporting"

Left December 2015, moved back to Boulder to work on consulting and side projects

Best part of Microsoft? The [hackathon](http://blogs.microsoft.com/jobs/story-library/oneweek-hackathon-shows-culture-shift-at-microsoft/) - 2 days of working on whatever we wanted to work on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What I'm doing now

## Consulting

Independent, freelance, contract, consulting, whatever you want to call it

I build web apps, frontends, APIs, and bots for people and companies.

I work out of an office in Spark. Come say hi sometime!

## Barfly

I've got a side project that helps bars order liquor every week.

Bars have to order liquor in bulk from **distributors**. The problem is, each distributor carries different liquors, so bars have to put together 6-12 different distributor orders **every week**. On top of that, they have to order through **sales reps**, which usually only take text messages.
