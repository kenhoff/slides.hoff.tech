# Spark Classes

![](sparkboulder.jpeg)

[Spark Boulder](http://sparkboulder.com/) is an entrepreneurial student co-working space on the Hill! It was founded a couple years back by my buddy [Fletcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fletchrichman).

I'm teaching **Front End Web Dev** and **Back End Web Dev** at Spark Boulder in the Fall!

Apply at <http://sparkboulder.com/sparkclasses/> or email my buddy **Danny Walsh** (<mailto:danny@sparkboulder.com>) - he runs all the operations stuff for Spark. Or, you can leave your name on the sheet up here and he'll get in touch with you.

## The deets

Classes start **October 3rd**

2x a week for 10 weeks

Evening classes - works with a full-time student schedule

Integrated project-based assignments

Taught by industry professionals

$999 per semester

## Front End Web Dev

Portfolio sites, sites for local businesses, and client-side web apps

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery

Great for students who have never programmed before!

## Back End Web Dev

Create APIs, connect to databases, and handle authentication/payments

Prereq: 6+ months of a _programming_ language (not markup), or you've completed CSCI 1300.

# What I used to do

## Internships

USGS - detecting earthquakes with twitter - [usgs paper](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70006356) - [xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/723/)

![](xkcd_earthquakes.png)

lijit (now [sovrn](https://www.sovrn.com/)) - general development

[Rally Software](https://www.rallydev.com/) (now CA Technologies) - "intrapreneurial projects"

## CU Boulder

Graduated December 2013

Bachelor's of Science of Computer Science (HCC Track)

Senior Thesis: [Improving Educational Game Design Methods](https://github.com/kenhoff/thesis/blob/master/KenHoffThesis.pdf)

Favorite class? Startup Essentials for Software Engineering (CSCI 4830?)

_(might have been replaced by Entrepreneurial Capstone now)_

## Microsoft

Started working for Microsoft **July 2014** in Seattle, WA

I was a "Program Manager" - Microsoft's version of a "Product Manager" (different than a "[Project Manager](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-de-haaff/the-product-manager-vs-pr_b_8040402.html)")

![](bobs.jpg)

> Well-well look. I already told you: I deal with the god damn customers so the engineers don't have to. I have people skills; I am good at dealing with people. Can't you understand that? What the hell is wrong with you people?

Worked on **[Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/)** - on a tiny little feature called "Reporting"

Left **December 2015**, moved back to Boulder to work on consulting and side projects

Best part of Microsoft? The [hackathon](http://blogs.microsoft.com/jobs/story-library/oneweek-hackathon-shows-culture-shift-at-microsoft/) - 2 days of working on whatever we wanted to work on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What I'm doing now

## Consulting

Independent, freelance, contract, consulting, whatever you want to call it

I build web apps, frontends, APIs, and bots for people and companies.

More about me and my consulting work at [hoff.tech](https://hoff.tech/).

I work out of an office in Spark. Come say hi sometime!

## Barfly

I've got a side project that helps bars order liquor every week.

Bars have to order liquor in bulk from **distributors**. The problem is, each distributor carries different liquors, so bars have to put together 6-12 different distributor orders **every week**. On top of that, they have to order through **sales reps**, which usually only take text messages.

I built a web app to help with the process. Bar owners just see a list of all of their liquors, punch in what they need, and then we automatically send text messages to all of their sales reps.

![](barfly_sample_order.png)

I work with my buddy Peter, who runs [T/Aco](http://tacocolorado.com/) downtown on Walnut.

## Spark Classes

I'm teaching classes out of Spark, but you already heard about that!

One fun part is `@classbot`, a Slack bot that I built to replace my TA in the class!

To submit a web site that you built for an assignment, you first deploy your site to the internet, then send `@classbot` the URL to your site.

Then, `@classbot` goes to your site and _automatically_ grades it - you get a grade **instantly**, and you can submit assignments as many times as you want, whenever you want.

@classbot is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/kenhoff/classbot).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# I'm a web developer!

what does a web developer do?

Web developers is a pretty umbrella term, but I make **full-stack web apps**.

Examples of full-stack web apps are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, almost everything consumer-facing at Google, etc

## Facebook for Dogs

For example, if you asked me to make **Facebook for Dogs**, that would be a full-stack web app.

You'd need to be able to go to <http://facebookfordogs.com/>, sign up (add some personal information), find and follow other Facebook for Dogs ™ users, see their posts, and create your own post. Maybe you'd like email notifications, or to be able to pay for a premium account.

Apps aren't cheap! To get an idea of how much it would take to build your app, check out [estimatemyapp.com](https://estimatemyapp.com/).

# Web dev freestyling

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You too can be a web developer!

Let's make a simple landing page for your portfolio.

_(you can also do this later, the slides will always be available at this URL)_

You will need a **text editor** (Not Microsoft Word or Pages - use Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit on the Mac)

I use [Atom](https://atom.io/)! It's pretty friggin cool.

First, bust open that text editor, and create a new file `index.html` (note the extension! no `.txt` or `.rtf` here), and save it.

Then, put the following contents into your `index.html` file and save it:

```html
<h1>Yournamehere's Portfolio Site</h1>
```

Then, find your `index.html`, and double-click it to open it in your browser!

(you can also do `ctrl-O` or `⌘-O` from your browser)

# MOAR WEB DEV

For the next part of your portfolio's landing page, you'll need your favorite image from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/).

I like [mountains](https://unsplash.com/?photo=NDuPLKYRXQU)!

Download and save your file (upper right button) **in the same folder as your `index.html`**, and name it something like `mountains.jpeg`.

Replace the contents of your `index.html` file with the following:

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway:300,400,700" rel="stylesheet">
		<style>
			body {

			header {

				flex-direction: column;
				height: 100vh;
				background-image: url("mountains.jpeg");

	</head>
	<body>
